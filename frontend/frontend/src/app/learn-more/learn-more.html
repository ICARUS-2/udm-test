    <h2 class="text-secondary">Vector Shock</h2>
    <p>
        Vector Shock is an innovative Unity-based simulation game designed to
transform the abstract principles of electricity and magnetism into a tangible,
interactive experience for CEGEP and university-level physics students. By
creating a dynamic virtual sandbox, the game allows learners to visualize and
manipulate electric charges, field vectors, and magnetic forces in real-time,
bridging the gap between theoretical equations and their practical manifestations.
Students can experiment with constructing circuits, observing field line behavior,
and witnessing the outcomes of electromagnetic interactions without the
constraints of a physical lab. This hands-on approach not only reinforces core
concepts like Gauss’s Law, Faraday’s Law, and Lorentz force but also fosters
intuitive understanding through trial and error, making complex topics more
accessible and engaging. Vector Shock stands as a powerful educational tool
that empowers students to explore, discover, and master the fundamentals of
electromagnetism in an immersive digital environment.
